\title{EP 501 Homework 4:  Differentiation and Integration}

\maketitle

~\\
\textbf{Instructions:}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Submit all source code and publish Matlab results in .pdf form via Canvas.  Please zip all contents of your solution into single file and then submit in a single zip file.    
  \item Discussing the assignment with others is fine, but you must not copy anyone's code.  
  \item I must be able to run your code and produce all results by executing a single top-level Matlab script, e.g. \textsf{assignment1.m} or similar.  
  \item You may use any of the example codes from our course repository:  \url{https://github.com/mattzett/EP501/}.
  \item Do not copy verbatim any other codes (i.e. any source codes other than from our course repository).  You may use other examples as a reference but you must write you own programs (except for those I give you).  
    \item For demonstrating that your code is correct when you turn in the assignment, you must use the test problems given in the assignment text below.  

\end{itemize}
~\\~\\~\\
\textbf{Purpose of this assignment:}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Learn principles behind data fitting and polynomial approximation.  
  \item Develop good coding and documentation practices, such that your programs are easily understood by others.  
  \item Hone skills of developing, debugging, and testing your own software
  \item Learn how to build programs on top of existing codes
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Vector derivatives:  
  \begin{itemize}  
    \item[(a)] Plot the two components of the vector magnetic field defined by the piecewise function:
    \begin{equation}
      \mathbf{B}(x,y)= \left\{
      \begin{array}{c}
      \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi a^2} \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \left( - \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_x + \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \hat{\mathbf{e}}_y \right) \qquad \left( \sqrt{x^2+y^2} < a \right)
      \\
      \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \left( - \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_x + \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \hat{\mathbf{e}}_y \right) \qquad \left( \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \ge a \right)
      \end{array}
      \right.      
    \end{equation}
    Use an image plot (\texttt{imagesc}, \texttt{pcolor}) for each component.  Make sure you add a colorbar and axis labels to your plot.  
    \item[(b)]  Write a function to compute the curl of a vector field, i.e. $\nabla \times \mathbf{U}$.  Compute the three components of the numerical curl of this field and plot using \texttt{imagesc}, or \texttt{pcolor}
    \item[(c)]  Compute the curl analytically and plot this alongside your numerical approximation.  Demonstrate that they are suitably similar.  
    \item[(d)]  Write a function to compute the Laplacian of a scalar field, i.e. $\nabla^2 T$.  Test your function using:  
    
  \end{itemize}
  \item  Multidimensional integration...

    \item[(a)]

  \item Higher-order differences...
