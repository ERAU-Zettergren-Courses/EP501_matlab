\title{EP 501 Homework 2:  Nonlinear Equations and Root-finding}

\maketitle

\textbf{Instructions:}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Complete all problems.
  \item Submit all source code and publish Matlab results via Canvas.  
  \item Discussing the assignment with others is fine, but you must not copy anyone's code.  
  \item I must be able to run your code and produce all results by executing a single top-level Matlab script, e.g. \textsf{assignment1.m} or similar.  
  \item You may use any of the example codes from our course repository:  \url{https://github.com/mattzett/EP501/}.
  \item Do not copy verbatim any other codes (i.e. any source codes other than from our course repository).  You may use other examples as a reference but you must write you own programs (except for those I give you).  
  \item For demonstrating that your code is correct when you turn in the assignment, you must use the test problems in the course repository found in \texttt{linear\_algebra/testproblem.mat} (elimination method tests, including multiple right-hand sides), \texttt{linear\_algebra/lowertriang\_testproblem.mat} (lower triangular tests) and \\ \texttt{linear\_algebra/iterative\_testproblem.mat} (iterative method tests requiring diagonal dominance).  To load these data into your workspace use:
    \begin{verbatim}
    load testproblem.mat
    \end{verbatim}
    or double click on the .mat file in the Matlab file browser.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Purpose of this assignment:}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Learn principles behind numerical solutions to nonlinear algebraic equations.  
  \item Develop good coding and documentation practices, such that your programs are easily understood by others.  
  \item Hone skills of developing, debugging, and testing your own software
  \item Learn how to build programs on top of existing codes
\end{itemize}
