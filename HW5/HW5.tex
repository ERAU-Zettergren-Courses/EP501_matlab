\title{EP 501 Homework 4:  Differentiation, Integration, and Multidimensional functions}

\maketitle

\textbf{Instructions:}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Submit all source code and publish Matlab results in .pdf form via Canvas.  Please zip all contents of your solution into single file and then submit in a single zip file.    
  \item Discussing the assignment with others is fine, but you must not copy anyone's code.  
  \item I must be able to run your code and produce all results by executing a single top-level Matlab script, e.g. \textsf{assignment1.m} or similar.  
  \item You may use any of the example codes from our course repository:  \url{https://github.com/mattzett/EP501/}.
  \item Do not copy verbatim any other codes (i.e. any source codes other than from our course repository).  You may use other examples as a reference but you must write you own programs (except for those I give you).  

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Purpose of this assignment:}  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solve ODEs numerically and interpret the results.  
  \item Develop good coding and documentation practices, such that your programs are easily understood by others.  
  \item Exercise good judgement in numerical problem setup.
  \item Demonstrate higher reasoning to synthesize a problem and devise a basic algorithm to solve it.  
\end{itemize}
