\title{EP 501 Homework 1:  Numerical Linear Algebra}

\maketitle

\textbf{Instructions:}  Complete all problems and submit source code and published Matlab results via Canvas.  

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Basic elimination and substitution for linear equations
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Make a Matlab function that used simple elimination (without pivoting or scaling) - do not use any vectorized Matlab operations - write out all loops explicitly.  
    \item[(b)] Write and test a forward substitution function for a lower-triangular system (will be used again in later problems)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Matrix inversion methods
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Alter elimination to work for multiple right-hand sides
    \item[(b)] Implement Gauss-Jordan elimination in a function (you may want to reuse some code from your simple elimination function)
    \item[(c)] Find matrix inverse using Gauss Jordan elimination
    \item[(d)] Compare with builtin and use to solve a system.  
  \end{itemize}
  \item LU factorization application to solve linear systems
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Alter your simple elimination function to perform Doolittle LU factorization.  
    \item[(b)] Using just the output of the factorization and a back-substitution step, solve a linear system of equations
    \item[(c)] Use LU factors for a system to set up a solution for the same system with a different RHS using forward and backward substitution
    \item[(d)] Show that this process is faster for multiple RHS than performing simple elimination followed by backsubstitution (requires results from 2)
    \item[(e)] Use your LU factorization function to find a matrix inverse.  
  \end{itemize}
  \item Iterative methods - implement Gauss-Seidel and SOR and do some testing.  
  \item Determinants
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Write code or a function to calculate determinant from simple elimination  
    \item[(b)] Calculate determinant from Gaussian Elimination function...
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
